bastibl's 802.15.4 OQPSK phy block was modified to use the polyphase clock sync
block instead of the MM clock recovery block.

10.000 6 byte ACK packets were sent from an RZUSB stick 3 meters away from
a USRP N210 with an SBX daughterboard and no antenna. this scenario was 
performed twice to test the performance of the original block with the modified
block, comparing their packet error rate (PER). see per.sh to see how this
number was determined.

the parameters of the MM clock were not modified from bastibl's original 
implementation. in the new implementation, the MM clock recovery block was
replaced with the polyphase clock sync block, with the following parameters:

Samples/Symbol: 2
Loop Bandwidth: 0.063 # 2pi/10
Taps: firdes.root_raised_cosine(1,samp_rate,chip_rate,0.00016,32)
Filter Size: 32
Initial Phase: 16
Maximum Rate Deviation: 1.5
Output SPS: 1

(chip_rate = 4e6, samp_rate= 2e6)

the PER for the MM clock recovery block was 17.93%. 
the PER for the polyphase clock sync was 45.64%.
